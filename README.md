## 👤 About me
- 🎓 University of Virginia — Computer Science & Computer Engineering (GPA: 3.98)
- 💡 AI/ML intern and student developer focused on data handling, algorithm evaluation, and practical software development
- 🧭 Passionate about staying current with AI trends and shipping things that others can actually run
- 🧑‍🏫 Teaching Assistant (APMA 3100 — Probability): help students connect stats, data analysis, and AI ideas
- 🧪 Currently exploring: LLM apps (LoRA + RAG), MLOps on GitHub Actions, and reliable data pipelines

> I like clear docs, small composable systems, and making decisions with data.

## 🏀🎮🌲 Outside of code
- Gaming: strategy and co‑op titles; I enjoy designing game mechanics as much as playing them
- Basketball: pickup games for teamwork, quick reads, and staying active
- Nature: hiking local trails, sunrise/sunset walks, and exploring new parks
- More I’m into: photography (especially landscapes), calisthenics/fitness, cooking new recipes, learning board games, and dabbling in astronomy on clear nights
